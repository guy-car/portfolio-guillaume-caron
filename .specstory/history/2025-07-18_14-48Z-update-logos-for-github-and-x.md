# Update logos for GitHub and X (2025-07-18 14:48Z)

_**User**_

let's replace the arrow and "github" by the logo in public githublogo-white

Next to that, let's add a X logo (xlogo-white also in assets) that points to my X account
@https://x.com/_guillaumecaron

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you replace the arrow and "github" text with the GitHub logo and add an X logo that links to your X account. Let me first check what logo files are available in the assets directory.


---

Could not resolve URI: Error: Unable to resolve nonexistent file '/Users/guillaumecaronm4/Documents/dev/FRACTAL-BOOTCAMP/portfolio-guillaume-caron/app/assets'

---

Let me check the correct assets directory structure:


---

<details>
            <summary>Listed directory app • **10** results</summary>
        
| Name |
|-------|
| 📄 `global.css` |
| 📁 `blog` |
| 📄 `page.tsx` |
| 📁 `components` |
| 📄 `layout.tsx` |
| 📄 `sitemap.ts` |
| 📄 `not-found.tsx` |
| 📁 `og` |
| 📄 `robots.ts` |
| 📁 `rss` |

</details>

---

I see the assets are in the root directory. Let me check the public directory for the logo files:


---

<details>
            <summary>Listed directory public • **4** results</summary>
        
| Name |
|-------|
| 📄 `githublogo-white.svg` |
| 📄 `xlogo-white.png` |
| 📄 `xlogo-black.png` |
| 📄 `githublogo-black.svg` |

</details>

---

Perfect! I can see the logo files are in the public directory. Now I'll update the footer component to use the GitHub logo and add the X logo with the link to your X account.

+               height={20}
+               className="dark:invert"
+             />
            </a>
          </li>
```

Perfect! I've successfully updated the footer component with the following changes:

1. **Replaced the arrow icon and "github" text** with the GitHub logo (`githublogo-white.svg`)
2. **Added an X logo** (`xlogo-white.png`) that links to your X account at `https://x.com/_guillaumecaron`
3. **Added the Next.js Image import** for optimized image loading
4. **Applied dark mode styling** with the `dark:invert` class to ensure the logos look good in both light and dark themes

The footer now displays both logos side by side, and they'll automatically adapt to your site's color scheme. The logos are sized at 20x20 pixels and will maintain their aspect ratios.

ok nice add a linkedin icon next to those, it's in /public

@https://www.linkedin.com/in/guillaume-caron-00604934/

_**Assistant**_

I'll add a LinkedIn icon next to the GitHub and X logos. Let me first check what LinkedIn logo files are available in the public directory.


---

<details>
            <summary>Listed directory public • **5** results</summary>

| 📄 `githublogo-white.svg` |
| 📄 `xlogo-white.png` |
| 📄 `xlogo-black.png` |
| 📄 `githublogo-black.svg` |

</details>

---

Perfect! I can see there's a LinkedIn SVG file available. Now I'll add the LinkedIn icon to the footer component.


---

```diff
            </a>
          </li>

+             />
+           </a>
+         </li>
        </ul>
  
```

Great! I've successfully added the LinkedIn icon to your footer. The footer now includes:

1. **GitHub logo** - links to your GitHub profile
2. **X logo** - links to your X account  
3. **LinkedIn logo** - links to your LinkedIn profile at `https://www.linkedin.com/in/guillaume-caron-00604934/`

All three icons are consistently sized at 20x20 pixels and will display side by side in the footer. The LinkedIn icon uses the SVG file from your public directory, which should render nicely and scale well.

now align horizontall so logos look centered on the page

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll update the footer to center the logos horizontally on the page. Let me modify the footer component to use flexbox centering.


---

```diff
    return (
      <footer className="mb-16">
-       <ul className="font-sm mt-8 flex flex-col space-x-0 space-y-2 text-neutral-600 md:flex-row md:space-x-4 md:space-y-0 dark:text-neutral-300">
+       <ul className="font-sm mt-8 flex flex-col space-x-0 space-y-2 text-neutral-600 md:flex-row md:space-x-4 md:space-y-0 dark:text-neutral-300 justify-center items-center">
  
          <li>
```

---

Perfect! I've added `justify-center items-center` to the footer's ul element, which will:

- **`justify-center`** - Centers the logos horizontally on the page
- **`items-center`** - Centers the logos vertically within their container

Now the three social media logos (GitHub, X, and LinkedIn) will be perfectly centered horizontally on the page, creating a more balanced and visually appealing layout.

tey look aligned to the right now

---

_**Assistant**_

I see the issue! The logos are appearing on the right side instead of being centered. Let me check the current footer code and fix the centering issue.


---

Read file: app/components/footer.tsx

---

I see the issue. The problem is that the footer container itself might not be taking the full width, so the centering isn't working properly. Let me fix this by ensuring the footer takes full width and centers the content properly.


---

```diff
  export default function Footer() {
    return (
-     <footer className="mb-16">
-       <ul className="font-sm mt-8 flex flex-col space-x-0 space-y-2 text-neutral-600 md:flex-row md:space-x-4 md:space-y-0 dark:text-neutral-300 justify-center items-center">
+     <footer className="mb-16 w-full">
+       <ul className="font-sm mt-8 flex flex-col space-x-0 space-y-2 text-neutral-600 md:flex-row md:space-x-4 md:space-y-0 dark:text-neutral-300 justify-center items-center w-full">
  
          <li>
```

---

Perfect! I've added `w-full` to both the footer and ul elements to ensure they take the full width of the container. This should fix the centering issue and make the logos appear properly centered on the page instead of being aligned to the right.

The `w-full` class ensures that:
- The footer container takes the full available width
- The ul element also takes the full width
- Combined with `justify-center`, this will properly center the logos horizontally

Now the three social media icons should be perfectly centered on the page.
