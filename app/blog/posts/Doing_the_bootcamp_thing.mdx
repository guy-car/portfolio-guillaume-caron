I actually don’t really want to be writing right now. 

It feels like I’m forcing a premature reflection. I like to let reflections come naturally. I find the process of reflecting unpredictable in its shape and timing. It brings up a sense of wonder. It's mysterious. I like mystery. I respect it.
The Contrarian comes up: ‘how about conquering mystery?’. 
I see you, thanks, not right now.

Right now, I can just honor that my capacity for reflection is limited. I prefer to orient towards the path of least resistance, which is, doing.

This past week has been marked by a lot of doing. <br/> And doing it pretttttyyy fast. I felt some resistance about entering a program that champions productivity and speed. I don’t feel like the reflection on that level is ripe yet. So I’ll just say that after spending the past few years developing contemplative skills, which often involved slowing down and doing less, it’s quite a culture shock. <br/>
But as much as I’m externally jumbled by the NYC / Tech / Startup ethos: one that praises doing and doing fast, I’m internally not that disturbed. I’m actually really enjoying it. I like getting things done, particularly when it makes sense to get them done. I’m doing the bootcamp thing, we’re here to get stuff done, so that we have stuff to show coming out. Makes sense.

I’m noticing some reflective threads: 

- My relationship with work is being redefined, transformed. 
- My value system is getting shaken up. Certainties and postures loosen up. 
- One subthread is about the tension between slowness and speed. 
- How malleable opinions and values are. 
- How pleasant it is to be in a container with instructors that care, a physical space, a cohort. 


I feel like it would be premature to dive into any of them right now. I think of the word <i>décanter</i> in french. There is a natural purification process that tends to happen that way.<br/>What’s truly valuable rises to the surface, the rest just kind of floats around or sinks to the bottom.
