I did it!

I just graduated from Fractal Tech's AI Accelerator program!

üëâ ‚≠ê And I am available for work! ‚≠ê üëà 

3 months of insane intensity.
6 days a week at the rate of 60+ hours every week. 
I literally thought my brain was going to break at times.
I've never been so intellectually challenged. 
I kept pushing my limits.
I can't tell you the number of times I thought "I'm never gonna get this, it's too hard, too complicated".
And with patience, dedication and cool-headedness, I kept at it. 
To think that 9 months ago I didn't know what JavaScript was.
Now I can stand up a full stack app in hours if I need to.

And it's not just skills that I gained. This has been one of the most rich and transformative human experiences of my life.
It rewired my relationship with work, money, ambition, our economy.
I met so many great, inspiring people along the way. 
Peers, mentors, colleagues‚Ä¶ You all inspired me to excel at what I do, to not settle for "good enough", to look deep when I feel blocked.
Looking back, I feel grateful for such a vibrant community.
It re-ignited this drive in me to do great things with great people. 
To be part of projects that are exciting, ambitious, fun.

And this is just the beginning!
The NYC startup scene is thriving. 

If you or someone you know is hiring for full-stack engineer roles, I'd love to chat.
I'm also happy to connect with people in the tech / startup / AI / software engineer world - if there is someone I should meet, please make an intro!

I am excited for what's to come!
