# On Keeping AI Blind

AI has become this unexpected thinking partner for me.

I'm relentless with questions. 

Why this? Why that? 

I can ask about anything, as many times as I want. How incredible is that? 

And since I'm not using Cursor yet, it's essentially blind to my situation. Which means I have to provide it with context. And I'm finding that process extremely valuable. Which in turn means that I can't just throw my hands in the air and say 'it's not working, fix it for me'. 

In fact, I could, and I do, occasionally. It'll simply respond with a list of questions to try to understand my context. Which in turn enforces me to get clear about my own situation. To be specific about what's wrong. 

Where is your data stored? Which database? What version are you on? What's the actual context here? 

And then it's on me to actually pause and break it down, look for those answers.

It's teaching me to think systematically and logically about situations. Relentlessly.
