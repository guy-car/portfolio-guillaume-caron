## Resume PDF Export

Generate a single-page PDF from the live resume route using Puppeteer.

1. Run the app locally:

```
npm run dev
```

2. In a separate terminal, export the PDF (wait until the dev server is ready on http://localhost:3000):

```
npm run export:resume
```

The PDF will be saved at `public/resume.pdf`.
